# Break Out Clone

This is a clone of the classic game Break Out. The object is to move your paddle, located on the bottom, using the arrow keys and bounce the ball into the bricks. Destroy all the bricks to move on to the next level which will contain an extra row of bricks. This version will eventually max out on the number  of rows when they get a certain distance from the paddle/player. This, of course, is not my original idea. The clone is created with a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can be run from any browser. Check out the link to play the game yourself. This project and code is based on the project created by Kenny Yip Coding on their YouTube channel.
