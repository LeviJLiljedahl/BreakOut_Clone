# Break Out Clone

This is a clone of the classic game Break Out. This, of course, is not my original idea. The clone is created with a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can be run from any browser. Check out the link to play the game yourself. This project and code is based on the project created by Kenny Yip Coding on their YouTube channel.
